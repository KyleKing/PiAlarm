# CallStatusDashboard
A dashboard built with ReactJS and a Node backend using Express/Socket.io to keep track of the status of Twilio phone calls in real time.

In order to get everything running just clone this repository and run `npm install` in your terminal.

This code is based off of several posts I wrote for the Twilio blog:

Part 1: [Setting up React](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/08/setting-up-react-for-es6-with-webpack-and-babel-2.html)

Part 2: [Using call progress events with NodeJS](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/09/monitoring-call-progress-events-with-node-js-and-express.html)

Part 3: [Getting started with Socket.io and adding real time events to the backend of this app.](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/10/getting-started-with-socket-io-adding-real-time-events-to-your-node-js-express-app.html)
