> Long Term
- Use heat shrink tubing to better organize the wires with masking tape labels
- Add a plastic surface that presses the button like in my old alarm clock
- *Add the second light strip!
- Figure out what do to with the final housing
....
- Add a sleep button to allow the alarm to be turned off for an hour when I'm up before the first alarm > just one alarm per day
- Setup the dip switch to toggle between regular boot or with the alarm clock > too much work for little reward
- Use the spade connectors with matching gauge wire, find the seam on the spade terminal (usually top), and place seam up to crimp

- Cut perf by etching a box cutter fix times along a line of holes. Then snap. Sand as needed, but fiberglass is dangerous to sand FYI
- Setup strain relief on the lead wires
